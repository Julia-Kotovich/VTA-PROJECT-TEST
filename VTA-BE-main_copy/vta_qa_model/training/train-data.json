In Scrum, the work is organized in \"Sprints\" with a duration of 1 week to 1 month. During a sprint, requirements do not change. At the beginning of the sprint, there is a sprint planning event, in which work items are scheduled for the sprint. During the sprint, daily 15-minute \"scrum\" meetings take place for the team to organize and talk about potential issues. People indicate what they did the day before, and what they will do today. If there are impediments to the sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, there is a sprint review which presents the results of the sprint to stakeholders and uses demos. The group discusses their plans for the future. After that, there is a sprint retrospective where the team talks about their impediments, issues, and positive aspects and tries to improve the process for the next sprint and forward. Roles in Scrum are scrum master, product owner, and development team. A Scrum master is the person who takes care of the process, coaches people on scrum, ensures that there is harmony in the team, and makes sure that everyone is going in the right direction. A Product Owner defines what is in the product backlog, makes sure that everyone understands the backlog and the direction it takes for the requirements, and defines the requirements for the project and the sprint. The development team is made up of developers. Work in scrum is organized following a backlog. A backlog is a list of work items that are organized with priorities. Work items should be achievable in a sprint. Work items list the requirements of the change that needs to be done, they also often include a \"definition of done\". Often such requirements are expressed as a user story following this structure: \"As a \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I want to\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\". There is the \"product backlog\" for the whole product and the \"sprint backlog\" for a given sprint. If user stories are too large, they can be an \"Epic\" which then contains several user stories.",

The main concepts of source code versioning systems are a trunk and a branch. A truck is the main codebase. A branch is a modification of some version of the trunk. Branches can be merged with the trunk. In source code versioning systems, a commit is a changeset of the source code. Examples of historical systems for versioning are Concurrent Versioning Systems (CVS), Subversion (SVN),  and Team Foundation Server (TFS). Currently, the most used versioning systems are git, and perforce. Git is based on repositories and branches. Git is naturally distributed.  Git is extremely performant to pull (get) the code, create branches, merge branches create commits locally, and push (send) the code. it is based on full text and does not consider the directories as the main content hence it is easy to move content from one place to another (refactoring). There are many tools to perform the basic operations of git in a GUI or in your favorite IDE. An interesting post on branching can be found here https://bertrandmeyer.com/2013/09/30/the-laws-of-branching-part-1/.",

In essence, there are types of architecture that make sense from a requirements standpoint (functional and non-functional). Examples of software architecture are MVC (Model-View-Controller), ETL (Data Extraction-Transformation-Loading), Layered, Pub-sub (Publish subscribe), and Microservices. For quick reference, read Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern). Information about MVC can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller. Information about ETL can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load. Information on Layered architecture can be found at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html. Information on Pub-Sub can be found at https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/architecture. Information on Microservices can be found at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch04.html.

In providing your solution employ the following, present your solution quickly and efficiently, explain the benefits and how it solves your problem, and explain how it changes everything (paradigm shift). In your market/competitor analysis make a 2-dimensional graph (find the right axes where your solution fits), and show the size of the market if possible. In presenting your team, show 2+ founders, and show pictures. The business case should show a \"hockey stick\". Note in your business case do not promise anything before 3 years. In presenting your unique insights explain your unique insight (this is why you are the startup that will make it). The ask section is where you indicate what you need be it Money, Feedback, or Advertisement. The demo should be compelling. It should answer the problem statement nicely.

In Scrum, the work is organized in \"Sprints\" with a duration of 1 week to 1 month. During a sprint, requirements do not change. At the beginning of the sprint, there is a sprint planning event, in which work items are scheduled for the sprint. During the sprint, daily 15-minute \"scrum\" meetings take place for the team to organize and talk about potential issues. People indicate what they did the day before, and what they will do today. If there are impediments to the sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, there is a sprint review which presents the results of the sprint to stakeholders and uses demos. The group discusses their plans for the future. After that, there is a sprint retrospective where the team talks about their impediments, issues, and positive aspects and tries to improve the process for the next sprint and forward. Roles in Scrum are scrum master, product owner, and development team. A Scrum master is the person who takes care of the process, coaches people on scrum, ensures that there is harmony in the team, and makes sure that everyone is going in the right direction. A Product Owner defines what is in the product backlog, makes sure that everyone understands the backlog and the direction it takes for the requirements, and defines the requirements for the project and the sprint. The development team is made up of developers. Work in scrum is organized following a backlog. A backlog is a list of work items that are organized with priorities. Work items should be achievable in a sprint. Work items list the requirements of the change that needs to be done, they also often include a \"definition of done\". Often such requirements are expressed as a user story following this structure: \"As a \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I want to\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\". There is the \"product backlog\" for the whole product and the \"sprint backlog\" for a given sprint. If user stories are too large, they can be an \"Epic\" which then contains several user stories.",

Design tools help to present what a solution should look like and simulate its main interaction (it is needed to show it to stakeholders to make it concrete). Many people use PowerPoint to show what they want to have; it is even possible to make clickable demos that way.

The main concepts of source code versioning systems are a trunk and a branch. A truck is the main codebase. A branch is a modification of some version of the trunk. Branches can be merged with the trunk. In source code versioning systems, a commit is a changeset of the source code. Examples of historical systems for versioning are Concurrent Versioning Systems (CVS), Subversion (SVN),  and Team Foundation Server (TFS). Currently, the most used versioning systems are git, and perforce. Git is based on repositories and branches. Git is naturally distributed.  Git is extremely performant to pull (get) the code, create branches, merge branches create commits locally, and push (send) the code. it is based on full text and does not consider the directories as the main content hence it is easy to move content from one place to another (refactoring). There are many tools to perform the basic operations of git in a GUI or in your favorite IDE. An interesting post on branching can be found here https://bertrandmeyer.com/2013/09/30/the-laws-of-branching-part-1/.",

        "context": "I recommend reading this book (https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Oriented-Software-Architecture-System-Patterns/dp/0471958697) on software architecture patterns to understand what architectural patterns are. In essence, there are types of architecture that make sense from a requirements standpoint (functional and non-functional). Examples of software architecture are MVC (Model-View-Controller), ETL (Data Extraction-Transformation-Loading), Layered, Pub-sub (Publish subscribe), and Microservices. For quick reference, read Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern). Information about MVC can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller. Information about ETL can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load. Information on Layered architecture can be found at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html. Information on Pub-Sub can be found at https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/architecture. Information on Microservices can be found at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch04.html.

In Scrum, the work is organized in \"Sprints\" with a duration of 1 week to 1 month. During a sprint, requirements do not change. At the beginning of the sprint, there is a sprint planning event, in which work items are scheduled for the sprint. During the sprint, daily 15-minute \"scrum\" meetings take place for the team to organize and talk about potential issues. People indicate what they did the day before, and what they will do today. If there are impediments to the sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, there is a sprint review which presents the results of the sprint to stakeholders and uses demos. The group discusses their plans for the future. After that, there is a sprint retrospective where the team talks about their impediments, issues, and positive aspects and tries to improve the process for the next sprint and forward. Roles in Scrum are scrum master, product owner, and development team. A Scrum master is the person who takes care of the process, coaches people on scrum, ensures that there is harmony in the team, and makes sure that everyone is going in the right direction. A Product Owner defines what is in the product backlog, makes sure that everyone understands the backlog and the direction it takes for the requirements, and defines the requirements for the project and the sprint. The development team is made up of developers. Work in scrum is organized following a backlog. A backlog is a list of work items that are organized with priorities. Work items should be achievable in a sprint. Work items list the requirements of the change that needs to be done, they also often include a \"definition of done\". Often such requirements are expressed as a user story following this structure: \"As a I want to so that\". There is the \"product backlog\" for the whole product and the \"sprint backlog\" for a given sprint. If user stories are too large, they can be an \"Epic\" which then contains several user stories.",

In Scrum, the work is organized in \"Sprints\" with a duration of 1 week to 1 month. During a sprint, requirements do not change. At the beginning of the sprint, there is a sprint planning event, in which work items are scheduled for the sprint. During the sprint, daily 15-minute \"scrum\" meetings take place for the team to organize and talk about potential issues. People indicate what they did the day before, and what they will do today. If there are impediments to the sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, there is a sprint review which presents the results of the sprint to stakeholders and uses demos. The group discusses their plans for the future. After that, there is a sprint retrospective where the team talks about their impediments, issues, and positive aspects and tries to improve the process for the next sprint and forward. Roles in Scrum are scrum master, product owner, and development team. A Scrum master is the person who takes care of the process, coaches people on scrum, ensures that there is harmony in the team, and makes sure that everyone is going in the right direction. A Product Owner defines what is in the product backlog, makes sure that everyone understands the backlog and the direction it takes for the requirements, and defines the requirements for the project and the sprint. The development team is made up of developers. Work in scrum is organized following a backlog. A backlog is a list of work items that are organized with priorities. Work items should be achievable in a sprint. Work items list the requirements of the change that needs to be done, they also often include a \"definition of done\". Often such requirements are expressed as a user story following this structure: \"As a \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I want to\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\". There is the \"product backlog\" for the whole product and the \"sprint backlog\" for a given sprint. If user stories are too large, they can be an \"Epic\" which then contains several user stories.",

Design tools help to present what a solution should look like and simulate its main interaction (it is needed to show it to stakeholders to make it concrete). Many people use PowerPoint to show what they want to have; it is even possible to make clickable demos that way.

The main concepts of source code versioning systems are a trunk and a branch. A truck is the main codebase. A branch is a modification of some version of the trunk. Branches can be merged with the trunk. In source code versioning systems, a commit is a changeset of the source code. Examples of historical systems for versioning are Concurrent Versioning Systems (CVS), Subversion (SVN),  and Team Foundation Server (TFS). Currently, the most used versioning systems are git, and perforce. Git is based on repositories and branches. Git is naturally distributed.  Git is extremely performant to pull (get) the code, create branches, merge branches create commits locally, and push (send) the code. it is based on full text and does not consider the directories as the main content hence it is easy to move content from one place to another (refactoring). There are many tools to perform the basic operations of git in a GUI or in your favorite IDE. An interesting post on branching can be found here https://bertrandmeyer.com/2013/09/30/the-laws-of-branching-part-1/.",

In essence, there are types of architecture that make sense from a requirements standpoint (functional and non-functional). Examples of software architecture are MVC (Model-View-Controller), ETL (Data Extraction-Transformation-Loading), Layered, Pub-sub (Publish subscribe), and Microservices. For quick reference, read Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern). Information about MVC can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller. Information about ETL can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load.

The group will then create a clickable demo using a design tool and prepare slides for a 5-minute presentation. The assignment deliverables include a presentation in PDF or PPT format with a recorded demo and a report. The organization of the assignment involves individual work at the beginning, group announcements in the assistant session, and group presentations in session 3. The report should be submitted before session 4. Deliverable 1 includes a presentation with slides explaining the chosen idea, organization of group work, and lessons learned. Deliverable 2 is a report containing explanations of each group member's ideas, a detailed explanation of the chosen idea, a description of the demo, roles in the team, difficulties faced, solutions found, and lessons learned for future improvements.",

Students work on a single project throughout the course, allowing them to dive deeply into their chosen topic and apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Groups or tribes for the Capstone Project can be formed in several ways. Students may organize themselves into groups or tribes, or they may be assigned randomly if needed. Each group or tribe typically consists of four to five students. Students seeking placement in specific groups should contact the teaching assistants (TAs).",

During the first semester of the Capstone Project, students focus on creating and proposing mocks, performing requirements elicitation, prototyping, approaching customers and users, specifying user stories, and organizing themselves using collaborative tools. In the second semester, students work on describing and defending a software architecture, coding in groups and as a large team, integrating independent works, using a source code versioning system, and specifying user stories. In the third semester, students engage in practical cybersecurity, hold discussions with stakeholders, practice machine learning, work with continuous improvement tools, and organize themselves through collaborative tools.",

During the first semester of the Capstone Project, students focus on creating and proposing mocks, performing requirements elicitation, prototyping, approaching customers and users, specifying user stories, and organizing themselves using collaborative tools. In the second semester, students work on describing and defending a software architecture, coding in groups and as a large team, integrating independent works, using a source code versioning system, and specifying user stories. In the third semester, students engage in practical cybersecurity, hold discussions with stakeholders, practice machine learning, work with continuous improvement tools, and organize themselves through collaborative tools.  Students work on a single project throughout the course, allowing them to dive deeply into their chosen topic and apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Groups or tribes for the Capstone Project are created in several ways. Students may organize themselves into groups or tribes, or they may be assigned randomly if needed. Each group typically consists of four to five students.  A tribe consists of several groups. Students seeking placement in specific groups should contact the teaching assistants (TAs). The organizational points or grading of the capstone project is structured as follows; 1/3 of the grade being a cohort (tribe) grade, and 2/3 of the grade being a group assignment. Note that in rare cases group members are regarded independently.",

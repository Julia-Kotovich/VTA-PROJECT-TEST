        "context": "The Capstone Project spans three semesters, with each semester offering 5 ECTS credits, where each credit corresponds to 25 to 30 hours of work. In the first semester, students focus on creating and proposing mock-ups, conducting requirements elicitation, prototyping, engaging with customers and users, specifying user stories, and organizing themselves using collaborative tools. During the second semester, students concentrate on describing and defending software architecture, coding in both small groups and as a larger team, integrating independent work, utilizing a version control system, and continuing to specify user stories. In the third semester, students delve into practical cybersecurity, engage with stakeholders, practice machine learning, use continuous improvement tools, and maintain organization through collaborative tools. Throughout the project, students work on a single topic, allowing them to deeply explore and apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Groups, typically consisting of 4-5 students, are formed either by self-organization or random assignment if necessary, and a tribe is made up of 20-30 students. For specific group placements, students should contact the teaching assistants (TAs). The grading structure for the Capstone Project allocates 1/3 of the grade to the cohort (tribe) and 2/3 to the group assignment, with individual assessment in rare cases.",

        "context": "Several tools support the software development process, aiming to facilitate rather than control it. During the Capstone Project, if any tool proves ineffective, it can be changed based on feedback during retrospectives. The primary categories of tools that development teams require are design tools, design tools, source code versioning systems, software development platforms, and continuous integration servers. Design tools are used to visualize and simulate the main interactions of a solution, making it easier to present projects to stakeholders. PowerPoint is commonly used for this purpose, even allowing for the creation of clickable demos. Other examples include inVision, which facilitates the creation of initial drafts using Artboards (screens/landing visualizations) and interactions (defining events and their landing artboards). a web-based tool that stores and browses source code through repositories, while also managing the backlog and testing processes. Many such platforms are available, either for free or via subscription. Notable examples include GitHub (acquired by Microsoft and free for open-source projects), Gitlab and Gitorious (free, installable clones of GitHub), DevOps by Microsoft, and Jira by Atlassian. A continuous integration server automates pipelines by pulling from repositories, compiling code, running tests, and notifying developers of any issues. Prominent examples include Jenkins (open source and free), GitlabCI (open source and free), and Azure Pipelines (by Microsoft) In the Capstone Project course, students will use the processes and tools mentioned above. Most of the training for these tools will be conducted online through tutorials, with TAs available to assist and answer questions as needed. Understanding these basics is essential for performing well in the project.",

        "context": "Scrum is a framework primarily used in Agile software developmentbut is also applied in various other fields. In Scrum, work is organized into Sprints that last between 1 week and 1 month, during which requirements remain fixed. Each sprint begins with a sprint planning event where work items are scheduled. Throughout the sprint, daily 15-minute Scrum meetings are held for the team to organize and address potential issues, with team members sharing what they did the previous day and what they plan to do that day, as well as any impediments to sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, a sprint review presents the sprint's results to stakeholders, often using demos, and discusses future plans. Following this, a sprint retrospective is held where the team reviews impediments, issues, and positive aspects to improve the process for future sprints. Scrum roles include the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. The Scrum Master manages the process, coaches the team on Scrum practices, ensures team harmony, and keeps everyone aligned. The Product Owner defines the product backlog, ensures understanding of the backlog and its direction, and sets the requirements for the project and sprints. The Development Team consists of developers who work on the tasks. Work in Scrum is organized using a backlog, a prioritized list of work items. These items should be achievable within a sprint and typically include a definition of done, often expressed as user stories in the format: \"As a ... I want to ... so that ...\". The product backlog encompasses the entire product, while the sprint backlog pertains to a specific sprint. Large user stories can be broken down into Epics, which contain several user stories. In the Capstone Project, sprints last 2 weeks, each review is usually graded, and student feedback is gathered using Menti.",

        "context": "Teams can be challenging environments for both personal and collective growth. Common issues include feeling like everything is wrong, having difficulty understanding or being understood by others, perceiving teammates as too different, fearing that collaboration is impossible, disagreeing on common goals, and believing the problem isn't your fault, especially if you've successfully integrated into teams before. To better navigate and improve team dynamics, consider exploring resources on team development and building, such as Tuckman's model of team development. Detailed insights can be found in these readings: Stages of Team Development (https://www.challengeapplications.com/stages-of-team-development) and 5 Stages of Team Development (https://agilescrumguide.com/blog/files/tag-5-stages-of-team-development.html). These resources offer valuable information on the stages of team development and practical advice on fostering a cohesive team. For the Capstone Project, some tips for team collaboration include recognizing the current phase of team development, using strategies to progress to the next stage, being patient as things will settle if everyone remains positive, and letting go of minor issues when they are not significant to you.",

In Part 2, these ideas are presented to the group, discussed for their pros and cons, and one idea is collectively chosen for further development. Deliverables for this assignment include a presentation in PDF or PPT format with a recorded demo and a report. The assignment is organized as follows: individual work at the beginning, group announcements during the teaching assistant (TA) session, group presentations during the session specified in the course lecture, and submission of a report. The presentation should include one slide explaining the chosen idea (answering what, why, and how), one slide detailing the group's organization (meeting times, tools used, roles, and decision processes), and one slide on lessons learned. The report should feature a brief explanation of each group member's ideas, with their name and possibly pictures or screenshots, a detailed explanation of the chosen idea (answering what, why, and how), a description of the demo with screenshots, an outline of the team roles, a discussion of difficulties encountered and their solutions, and lessons learned (suggestions for future improvements or changes).",

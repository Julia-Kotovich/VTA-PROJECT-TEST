    "context": "The Capstone project provides a complete experience of software development from ideation to product. The formal course structure is a mix of formal presentations and guest presentations. The course structure includes requirements elicitations with stakeholders, fast design and prototyping, architecture, practicalities of cybersecurity development following agile processes, and development using state-of-the-art development tools (git repositories, integration servers, static analyzers). If you want to learn more about the Capstone Project course, check the article in the 2nd international workshop on frontiers in software engineering education (fisee 23), edited in lecture notes in computer science by springer (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48639-5_3). The instructor of the Capstone Project is Prof. Dr. Manuel Oriol. Manuel is a professor of computer science at Constructor Institute. He has 10 years of experience in academia, and 10 years in Industry, co-authored 60+ articles on software engineering and software architecture, and graduated 4 doctoral students, and 25+ MSc students. The teaching assistants are Muhammad Khalid and Julia Kotovich. Mohammed is a PhD Researcher and Lecturer at Constructor University. Julia Kotovich is a PhD Researcher at Constructor Institute. To succeed in the program, students must have a strong foundation in programming skills in an imperative language at the CS bachelor level, as well as knowledge of algorithms and data structures at the same level. These foundational skills enable students to tackle the complexities of the Capstone Project and other advanced coursework. The course plan includes design & ideation, architecture, and initial development, portal ready and deployed, and advanced concepts and refinements based on customer feedback. The course includes an opportunity for students to attend guest lectures, which are presentations given by external lecturers from industry or academia. These lectures cover best practices and other computer science-related topics, providing students with insights from experienced professionals in the field. The start time of guest lectures can be verified in the actual course schedule. Taking this course is mandatory for students enrolled in the AST and CSSE programs. It is a crucial part of the curriculum that ensures you gain the necessary practical and theoretical skills for your future career in software engineering and related fields.",

    "context": "The Capstone Project spans three semesters. Each semester offers 5 ECTS credits and each ECTS credit corresponds to 25 to 30 working hours. During the first semester of the Capstone Project, students focus on creating and proposing mocks, performing requirements elicitation, prototyping, approaching customers and users, specifying user stories, and organizing themselves using collaborative tools. In the second semester, students work on describing and defending a software architecture, coding in groups and as a large team, integrating independent works, using a source code versioning system, and specifying user stories. In the third semester, students engage in practical cybersecurity, hold discussions with stakeholders, practice machine learning, work with continuous improvement tools, and organize themselves through collaborative tools. Students work on a single project throughout the course, allowing them to dive deeply into their chosen topic and apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Groups or tribes for the Capstone Project are created in several ways. Students may organize themselves into groups or tribes, or they may be assigned randomly if needed. Each group typically consists of four to five students. A tribe consists of several groups. Students seeking placement in specific groups should contact the teaching assistants (TAs). The organizational points or grading of the capstone project is structured as follows; 1/3 of the grade being a cohort (tribe) grade, and 2/3 of the grade being a group assignment. Note that in rare cases group members are regarded independently.",

    "context": "There are several tools for the processes in software development. These tools are meant to support the development not to control it. During the development process in capstone, if tools do not work and this is expressed in a retrospective, it can be changed. The four main categories of tools that development teams need are design tools, source code versioning systems, software development platforms, and continuous integration servers. Design tools help to present what a solution should look like and simulate its main interaction (it is needed to show a project to stakeholders to make it concrete). Many people use PowerPoint to show what they want to have. It is even possible to make clickable demos that way. Many tools exist, an example is inVision. This tool can be used to easily create a first draft. The main concepts are Artboards (screens/landing visualizations), and interactions. Interactions define an event and a landing artboard. A software development platform is a web tool that allows one to store and browse source code through a repository and organize the backlog and the testing process. There are now many platforms online that provide these kinds of functionalities for free or for subscriptions. Popular examples include GitHub (bought by Microsoft and is free for open source), Gitlab and Gitorious ( free clones of GitHub to use and install on-premises), DevOps by Microsoft, and Jira by Atlassian. A continuous integration server is a server that runs pipelines pulls from a repository, compiles the code, runs tests automatically, and notifies you if there is a problem. Few recognized and professional tools exist. Examples are Jenkins (open source and free), GitlabCI (open source and free), and Azure Pipelines (by Microsoft). In the capstone project course, we will use the processes and tools that we presented. Much of the training for tools should be done online by following tutorials. All these are the basics that everyone needs to understand to do a decent job. TA session will help and answer questions whenever possible.",

    "context": "Scrum is a framework primarily used in Agile software developmentbut is also applied in various other fields. In Scrum, work is organized into Sprints that last between 1 week and 1 month, during which requirements remain fixed. Each sprint begins with a sprint planning event where work items are scheduled. Throughout the sprint, daily 15-minute Scrum meetings are held for the team to organize and address potential issues, with team members sharing what they did the previous day and what they plan to do that day, as well as any impediments to sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, a sprint review presents the sprint's results to stakeholders, often using demos, and discusses future plans. Following this, a sprint retrospective is held where the team reviews impediments, issues, and positive aspects to improve the process for future sprints. Scrum roles include the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. The Scrum Master manages the process, coaches the team on Scrum practices, ensures team harmony, and keeps everyone aligned. The Product Owner defines the product backlog, ensures understanding of the backlog and its direction, and sets the requirements for the project and sprints. The Development Team consists of developers who work on the tasks. Work in Scrum is organized using a backlog, a prioritized list of work items. These items should be achievable within a sprint and typically include a definition of done, often expressed as user stories in the format: \"As a ... I want to ... so that ...\". The product backlog encompasses the entire product, while the sprint backlog pertains to a specific sprint. Large user stories can be broken down into Epics, which contain several user stories. In the Capstone Project, sprints last 2 weeks, each review is usually graded, and student feedback is gathered using Menti.",

A recommended resource for understanding software architecture patterns is the book Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns (https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Oriented-Software-Architecture-System-Patterns/dp/0471958697). Architectural types are selected based on functional and non-functional requirements. Examples include MVC (Model-View-Controller), ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), Layered, Pub-Sub (Publish-Subscribe), and Microservices. For a quick reference, you can visit the Wikipedia page on architectural patterns (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern).

    "context": "Teams can be challenging environments for both personal and collective growth. Common issues include feeling like everything is wrong, having difficulty understanding or being understood by others, perceiving teammates as too different, fearing that collaboration is impossible, disagreeing on common goals, and believing the problem isn't your fault, especially if you've successfully integrated into teams before. To better navigate and improve team dynamics, consider exploring resources on team development and building, such as Tuckman's model of team development. Detailed insights can be found in these readings: Stages of Team Development (https://www.challengeapplications.com/stages-of-team-development) and 5 Stages of Team Development (https://agilescrumguide.com/blog/files/tag-5-stages-of-team-development.html). These resources offer valuable information on the stages of team development and practical advice on fostering a cohesive team. For the Capstone Project, some tips for team collaboration include recognizing the current phase of team development, using strategies to progress to the next stage, being patient as things will settle if everyone remains positive, and letting go of minor issues when they are not significant to you.",

In Part 2, these ideas are presented to the group, discussed for their pros and cons, and one idea is collectively chosen for further development. Deliverables for this assignment include a presentation in PDF or PPT format with a recorded demo and a report. The assignment is organized as follows: individual work at the beginning, group announcements during the teaching assistant (TA) session, group presentations during the session specified in the course lecture, and submission of a report. The presentation should include one slide explaining the chosen idea (answering what, why, and how), one slide detailing the group's organization (meeting times, tools used, roles, and decision processes), and one slide on lessons learned. The report should feature a brief explanation of each group member's ideas, with their name and possibly pictures or screenshots, a detailed explanation of the chosen idea (answering what, why, and how), a description of the demo with screenshots, an outline of the team roles, a discussion of difficulties encountered and their solutions, and lessons learned (suggestions for future improvements or changes).",

    "context": "Scrum is a framework used primarily in Agile software development, but it's also utilized in various other fields. In Scrum, the work is organized in Sprints with a duration of 1 week to 1 month. During a sprint, requirements do not change. At the beginning of the sprint, there is a sprint planning event, in which work items are scheduled for the sprint. During the sprint, daily 15-minute scrum meetings take place for the team to organize and talk about potential issues. People indicate what they did the day before, and what they will do today. If there are impediments to the sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, there is a sprint review which presents the results of the sprint to stakeholders and uses demos. The group discusses their plans for the future. After that, there is a sprint retrospective where the team talks about their impediments, issues, and positive aspects and tries to improve the process for the next sprint and forward. Roles in Scrum are scrum master, product owner, and development team. A Scrum master is the person who takes care of the process, coaches people on scrum, ensures that there is harmony in the team, and makes sure that everyone is going in the right direction. A Product Owner defines what is in the product backlog, makes sure that everyone understands the backlog and the direction it takes for the requirements, and defines the requirements for the project and the sprint. The development team is made up of developers. Work in scrum is organized following a backlog. A backlog is a list of work items that are organized with priorities. Work items should be achievable in a sprint. Work items list the requirements of the change that needs to be done, they also often include a definition of done. Often such requirements are expressed as a user story following this structure: \"As a ... I want to ... so that ...\". There is the product backlog for the whole product and the sprint backlog for a given sprint. If user stories are too large, they can be an Epic which then contains several user stories. In the capstone project, a sprint is 2 weeks long, each review is typically graded, and each time student feedback is gathered using Menti.",

    "context": "Software architecture is a high-level view of a piece of software indicating its main subparts, an explanation of the diverse pieces of software that collaborate, or simply a boxes and arrow diagram (or several). The book Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns (https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Oriented-Software-Architecture-System-Patterns/dp/0471958697) is a suggested resource for learning about software architecture patterns. In essence, there are types of architecture that make sense from a requirements standpoint (functional and non-functional). Examples of software architecture are MVC (Model-View-Controller), ETL (Data Extraction-Transformation-Loading), Layered, Pub-sub (Publish subscribe), and Microservices. For quick reference on software architecture, visit the following Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern). Information about MVC can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller). Information about ETL can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load). Information on Layered architecture can be found at (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html). Information on Pub-Sub can be found at (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/architecture). Information on Microservices can be found at (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch04.html). Many other books on software architecture exist here are a few recommendations (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/, https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-2nd/9781492034018/, https://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104).",

    "context": "An important aspect of a software product is the need to talk to stakeholders. To do this effectively, you have to prepare a pitch and a demo. A pitch should take 2-5 minutes, be simple, straight to the point, fun (if possible), and insightful. It should let people understand why they should give you money. A pitch should be structured as follows: problem (job-to-be-done), your solution (why is your solution creating a paradigm shift), market and competitor analysis, team, business case, unique insights that you have, and ask. The problem section answers the \"why\" question. Start with a question like, \"Did you ever ask yourself?\" and explain the problem from the customer's perspective. Your solution answers \"what\" and \"how.\". Present your solution quickly and efficiently, explain the benefits, how it solves the problem, and how it changes everything (paradigm shift). For market and competitor analysis, make a 2-dimensional graph (find the right axes where your solution fits) and show the market size if possible. In the team section, present your team with 2+ founders( include pictures). The business case should show a \"hockey stick\" growth projection but not promise anything before 3 years. Explain your unique insight (this is why you are the startup that will make it). In the ask section, indicate what you need, be it money, feedback, or advertisement. The demo should be compelling, answer the problem statement nicely, be short, and work.",

    "context": "Teams can be challenging environments for personal and collective growth. Common reasons include feeling that everything is wrong, struggling to understand others or to be understood, perceiving teammates as too different, fearing that collaboration is impossible, disagreeing on common goals, and believing that the problem isn't your fault (especially if you've integrated well into teams before). To better navigate and improve team dynamics, consider exploring the following resources on team development and building: Tuckman's model of team development, which is detailed in these readings: (https://www.challengeapplications.com/stages-of-team-development) and (https://agilescrumguide.com/blog/files/tag-5-stages-of-team-development.html). These resources provide valuable insights into the stages of team development and practical guidance on fostering a cohesive team. Some tips for team collaboration in the capstone project are as follows; when interacting with others in a team recognize the phase of team development you are in, use strategies to get to the next level, wait for things to settle, because they will if everyone stays positive (some teams don't get away from some of these steps because they do not feel they can succeed and also, do not think it will not happen in a new team because you already know the others), let go some of the things when it is not important for you.",

Part 1 is individual, where each student must come up with an idea for a web application that is innovative, useful, and simple to explain. Part 2 involves presenting the ideas to the group, discussing advantages and disadvantages, and collectively choosing one idea to develop further. The group will then create a clickable demo using a design tool and prepare slides for a 5-minute presentation. The assignment deliverables include a presentation in PDF or PPT format with a recorded demo and a report. For the first assignment, the organization of the assignment is as follows; individual work at the beginning, announcement of groups at the teaching assistant (TA) session, presentation given by groups in the session stated in the course lecture, and the delivery of a report. The presentation deliverable should contain an explanation about the idea that was chosen that answers the question what? why? how? ( 1 slide), how the group work was organized (include. meeting times, tools you used, roles and decision processes, 1 slide), and finally lessons learned (1 slide). The report deliverable should include a short explanation of the ideas of each group member with their name on one page each possibly with pictures or screenshots, and a detailed explanation of the chosen idea that answers the three questions what? why? how? , a description of the demo with screenshots, a description of the roles in the team, a description of the difficulties and the solutions you found, and lessons learned (what could be improved or changed in the future).",

    "context": "The Capstone project offers a comprehensive journey through software development, from initial idea to final product. The course blends formal lectures with guest presentations, covering requirement elicitation with stakeholders, rapid design and prototyping, architecture, cybersecurity development within agile processes, and the use of advanced development tools like git repositories, integration servers, and static analyzers. For more details on the Capstone Project course, refer to the article in the 2nd international workshop on frontiers in software engineering education (fisee 23), published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science by Springer (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48639-5_3). The course is led by Prof. Dr. Manuel Oriol, a computer science professor at Constructor Institute with a decade of experience in both academia and industry. He has co-authored over 60 articles on software engineering and software architecture and has supervised 4 doctoral and more than 25 MSc students. The teaching assistants are Muhammad Khalid, a PhD researcher and lecturer at Constructor University, and Julia Kotovich, a PhD researcher at Constructor Institute. To excel in this program, students need strong programming skills in an imperative language and knowledge of algorithms and data structures at the bachelor's level in computer science. These essential skills prepare students to handle the challenges of the Capstone Project and other advanced coursework. The course outline includes phases such as design & ideation, architecture, initial development, portal readiness and deployment, and advanced refinements based on customer feedback. Additionally, students have the opportunity to attend guest lectures by industry and academic professionals, which cover best practices and various computer science topics, providing valuable insights from experienced experts. The exact times for these guest lectures are available in the course schedule. This course is mandatory for students in the AST and CSSE programs, playing a crucial role in their curriculum by imparting essential practical and theoretical skills necessary for future careers in software engineering and related fields.",

    "context": "The Capstone Project spans three semesters, with each semester offering 5 ECTS credits, where each credit corresponds to 25 to 30 hours of work. In the first semester, students focus on creating and proposing mock-ups, conducting requirements elicitation, prototyping, engaging with customers and users, specifying user stories, and organizing themselves using collaborative tools. During the second semester, students concentrate on describing and defending software architecture, coding in both small groups and as a larger team, integrating independent work, utilizing a version control system, and continuing to specify user stories. In the third semester, students delve into practical cybersecurity, engage with stakeholders, practice machine learning, use continuous improvement tools, and maintain organization through collaborative tools. Throughout the project, students work on a single topic, allowing them to deeply explore and apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Groups, typically consisting of 4-5 students, are formed either by self-organization or random assignment if necessary, and a tribe is made up of 20-30 students. For specific group placements, students should contact the teaching assistants (TAs). The grading structure for the Capstone Project allocates 1/3 of the grade to the cohort (tribe) and 2/3 to the group assignment, with individual assessment in rare cases.",

    "context": "Several tools support the software development process, aiming to facilitate rather than control it. During the Capstone Project, if any tool proves ineffective, it can be changed based on feedback during retrospectives. The primary categories of tools that development teams require are design tools, design tools, source code versioning systems, software development platforms, and continuous integration servers. Design tools are used to visualize and simulate the main interactions of a solution, making it easier to present projects to stakeholders. PowerPoint is commonly used for this purpose, even allowing for the creation of clickable demos. Other examples include inVision, which facilitates the creation of initial drafts using Artboards (screens/landing visualizations) and interactions (defining events and their landing artboards). a web-based tool that stores and browses source code through repositories, while also managing the backlog and testing processes. Many such platforms are available, either for free or via subscription. Notable examples include GitHub (acquired by Microsoft and free for open-source projects), Gitlab and Gitorious (free, installable clones of GitHub), DevOps by Microsoft, and Jira by Atlassian. A continuous integration server automates pipelines by pulling from repositories, compiling code, running tests, and notifying developers of any issues. Prominent examples include Jenkins (open source and free), GitlabCI (open source and free), and Azure Pipelines (by Microsoft) In the Capstone Project course, students will use the processes and tools mentioned above. Most of the training for these tools will be conducted online through tutorials, with TAs available to assist and answer questions as needed. Understanding these basics is essential for performing well in the project.",

        "context": "The Capstone project provides a complete experience of software development from ideation to product. The formal course structure is a mix of formal presentations and guest presentations. The course structure includes requirements elicitations with stakeholders, fast design and prototyping, architecture, practicalities of cybersecurity development following agile processes, and development using state-of-the-art development tools (git repositories, integration servers, static analyzers). If you want to learn more about the Capstone Project course, check the article in the 2nd international workshop on frontiers in software engineering education (fisee 23), edited in lecture notes in computer science by springer (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48639-5_3). The instructor of the Capstone Project is Prof Dr Manuel Oriol. Manuel is a professor of computer science at Constructor Institute. He has 10 years of experience in academia, and 10 years in Industry, co-authored 60+ articles on software engineering and software architecture, and graduated 4 doctoral students, and 25+ MSc students. The teaching assistants are Muhammad Khalid and Julia Kotovich. Mohammed is a PhD Researcher and Lecturer at Constructor University. Julia Kotovich is a PhD Researcher at Constructor Institute. To succeed in the program, students must have a strong foundation in programming skills in an imperative language at the CS bachelor level, as well as knowledge of algorithms and data structures at the same level. These foundational skills enable students to tackle the complexities of the Capstone Project and other advanced coursework. The course plan includes design & ideation, architecture, and initial development, portal ready and deployed, and advanced concepts and refinements based on customer feedback. The course includes an opportunity for students to attend guest lectures, which are presentations given by external lecturers from industry or academia. These lectures cover best practices and other computer science-related topics, providing students with insights from experienced professionals in the field. The start time of guest lectures can be verified in the actual course schedule. Taking this course is mandatory for students enrolled in the AST and CSSE programs. It is a crucial part of the curriculum that ensures you gain the necessary practical and theoretical skills for your future career in software engineering and related fields.",

        "context": "The Capstone Project spans three semesters. Each semester offers 5 ECTS credits and each ECTS credit corresponds to 25 to 30 working hours. During the first semester of the Capstone Project, students focus on creating and proposing mocks, performing requirements elicitation, prototyping, approaching customers and users, specifying user stories, and organizing themselves using collaborative tools. In the second semester, students work on describing and defending a software architecture, coding in groups and as a large team, integrating independent works, using a source code versioning system, and specifying user stories. In the third semester, students engage in practical cybersecurity, hold discussions with stakeholders, practice machine learning, work with continuous improvement tools, and organize themselves through collaborative tools. Students work on a single project throughout the course, allowing them to dive deeply into their chosen topic and apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Groups or tribes for the Capstone Project are created in several ways. Students may organize themselves into groups or tribes, or they may be assigned randomly if needed. Each group typically consists of four to five students. A tribe consists of several groups. Students seeking placement in specific groups should contact the teaching assistants (TAs). The organizational points or grading of the capstone project is structured as follows; 1/3 of the grade being a cohort (tribe) grade, and 2/3 of the grade being a group assignment. Note that in rare cases group members are regarded independently.",

        "context": "There are several tools for the processes in software development. These tools are meant to support the development not to control it. During the development process in capstone, if tools do not work and this is expressed in a retrospective, it can be changed. The four main categories of tools that development teams need are design tools, source code versioning systems, software development platforms, and continuous integration servers. Design tools help to present what a solution should look like and simulate its main interaction (it is needed to show a project to stakeholders to make it concrete). Many people use PowerPoint to show what they want to have. It is even possible to make clickable demos that way. Many tools exist, an example is inVision. This tool can be used to easily create a first draft. The main concepts are Artboards (screens/landing visualizations), and interactions. Interactions define an event and a landing artboard. A software development platform is a web tool that allows one to store and browse source code through a repository and organize the backlog and the testing process. There are now many platforms online that provide these kinds of functionalities for free or for subscriptions. Popular examples include GitHub (bought by Microsoft and is free for open source), Gitlab and Gitorious ( free clones of GitHub to use and install on-premises), DevOps by Microsoft, and Jira by Atlassian. A continuous integration server is a server that runs pipelines pulls from a repository, compiles the code, runs tests automatically, and notifies you if there is a problem. Few recognized and professional tools exist. Examples are Jenkins (open source and free), GitlabCI (open source and free), and Azure Pipelines (by Microsoft). In the capstone project course, we will use the processes and tools that we presented. Much of the training for tools should be done online by following tutorials. All these are the basics that everyone needs to understand to do a decent job. TA session will help and answer questions whenever possible.",

        "context": "Scrum is a framework used primarily in Agile software development, but it's also utilized in various other fields. In Scrum, the work is organized in Sprints with a duration of 1 week to 1 month. During a sprint, requirements do not change. At the beginning of the sprint, there is a sprint planning event, in which work items are scheduled for the sprint. During the sprint, daily 15-minute scrum meetings take place for the team to organize and talk about potential issues. People indicate what they did the day before, and what they will do today. If there are impediments to the sprint goals. At the end of the sprint, there is a sprint review which presents the results of the sprint to stakeholders and uses demos. The group discusses their plans for the future. After that, there is a sprint retrospective where the team talks about their impediments, issues, and positive aspects and tries to improve the process for the next sprint and forward. Roles in Scrum are scrum master, product owner, and development team. A Scrum master is the person who takes care of the process, coaches people on scrum, ensures that there is harmony in the team, and makes sure that everyone is going in the right direction. A Product Owner defines what is in the product backlog, makes sure that everyone understands the backlog and the direction it takes for the requirements, and defines the requirements for the project and the sprint. The development team is made up of developers. Work in scrum is organized following a backlog. A backlog is a list of work items that are organized with priorities. Work items should be achievable in a sprint. Work items list the requirements of the change that needs to be done, they also often include a definition of done. Often such requirements are expressed as a user story following this structure: \"As a ... I want to ... so that ...\". There is the product backlog for the whole product and the sprint backlog for a given sprint. If user stories are too large, they can be an Epic which then contains several user stories. In the capstone project, a sprint is 2 weeks long, each review is typically graded, and each time student feedback is gathered using Menti.",

The book Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns (https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Oriented-Software-Architecture-System-Patterns/dp/0471958697) is a suggested resource for learning about software architecture patterns. In essence, there are types of architecture that make sense from a requirements standpoint (functional and non-functional). Examples of software architecture are MVC (Model-View-Controller), ETL (Data Extraction-Transformation-Loading), Layered, Pub-sub (Publish subscribe), and Microservices. For quick reference on software architecture, visit the following Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern). Information about MVC can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller). Information about ETL can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load). Information on Layered architecture can be found at (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html). Information on Pub-Sub can be found at (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/architecture). Information on Microservices can be found at (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch04.html). Many other books on software architecture exist here are a few recommendations (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/, https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-2nd/9781492034018/, https://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104).",

A pitch should take 2-5 minutes, be simple, straight to the point, fun (if possible), and insightful. It should let people understand why they should give you money. A pitch should be structured as follows: problem (job-to-be-done), your solution (why is your solution creating a paradigm shift), market and competitor analysis, team, business case, unique insights that you have, and ask. The problem section answers the \"why\" question. Start with a question like, \"Did you ever ask yourself?\" and explain the problem from the customer's perspective. Your solution answers \"what\" and \"how.\". Present your solution quickly and efficiently, explain the benefits, how it solves the problem, and how it changes everything (paradigm shift). For market and competitor analysis, make a 2-dimensional graph (find the right axes where your solution fits) and show the market size if possible. In the team section, present your team with 2+ founders( include pictures). The business case should show a \"hockey stick\" growth projection but not promise anything before 3 years. Explain your unique insight (this is why you are the startup that will make it). In the ask section, indicate what you need, be it money, feedback, or advertisement. The demo should be compelling, answer the problem statement nicely, be short, and work.",

Common reasons include feeling that everything is wrong, struggling to understand others or to be understood, perceiving teammates as too different, fearing that collaboration is impossible, disagreeing on common goals, and believing that the problem isn't your fault (especially if you've integrated well into teams before). To better navigate and improve team dynamics, consider exploring the following resources on team development and building: Tuckman's model of team development, which is detailed in these readings: (https://www.challengeapplications.com/stages-of-team-development) and (https://agilescrumguide.com/blog/files/tag-5-stages-of-team-development.html). These resources provide valuable insights into the stages of team development and practical guidance on fostering a cohesive team. Some tips for team collaboration in the capstone project are as follows; when interacting with others in a team recognize the phase of team development you are in, use strategies to get to the next level, wait for things to settle, because they will if everyone stays positive (some teams don't get away from some of these steps because they do not feel they can succeed and also, do not think it will not happen in a new team because you already know the others), let go some of the things when it is not important for you.",

Part 2 involves presenting the ideas to the group, discussing advantages and disadvantages, and collectively choosing one idea to develop further. The group will then create a clickable demo using a design tool and prepare slides for a 5-minute presentation. The assignment deliverables include a presentation in PDF or PPT format with a recorded demo and a report. For the first assignment, the organization of the assignment is as follows; individual work at the beginning, announcement of groups at the teaching assistant (TA) session, presentation given by groups in the session stated in the course lecture, and the delivery of a report. The presentation deliverable should contain an explanation about the idea that was chosen that answers the question what? why? how? ( 1 slide), how the group work was organized (include. meeting times, tools you used, roles and decision processes, 1 slide), and finally lessons learned (1 slide). The report deliverable should include a short explanation of the ideas of each group member with their name on one page each possibly with pictures or screenshots, and a detailed explanation of the chosen idea that answers the three questions what? why? how? , a description of the demo with screenshots, a description of the roles in the team, a description of the difficulties and the solutions you found, and lessons learned (what could be improved or changed in the future).",
